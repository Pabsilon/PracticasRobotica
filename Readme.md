## Practicas de Robotica de 2016-2017 ##  
  
So far, most of the repo has been used to keep data stored.  
The Thesseus folder contains a program in C wich uses a   
raspberry pi B mounted on a basic robot:  
	-Two traction wheels.  
	-Two light sensors.  
	-Two proximity sensors.  
It has to do two things:  
	-Follow a black line drawn on the floor.  
	-Get out of a simple maze as fast as possible.
